# system/auth Contract

Chinese version: [SYSTEM_AUTH_CONTRACT.md](./SYSTEM_AUTH_CONTRACT.md)

This document defines the execution contract for the Pantheon `system/auth` capability domain.

It locks down the responsibility boundaries for authentication, sessions, security center, login logs, and authentication strategy so that `auth`, `iam`, `org`, and `config` do not collapse back into one oversized “system security misc room”.

## 1. Background

One of Pantheon’s earliest structural problems was that authentication and backoffice user management were written together.

Without a `system/auth` contract, the likely regressions are:

- login, refresh, logout, sessions, passwords, and login logs getting pushed back into the user module
- security center and user-management pages collapsing into one capability domain
- reserved capabilities such as `MFA / CAPTCHA / SSO` having no stable landing place
- the authentication primary path being dragged down by backoffice CRUD concerns

This contract makes the ownership explicit:

> `auth` is responsible for “who you are, whether you can log in, whether your session is still valid, and how security policy applies,” not for system-management CRUD.

## 2. Ownership Layer

This contract belongs to `system/auth`.

It covers:

- login
- refresh-token rotation
- logout
- current principal identity
- current-account session management
- login logs
- security center
- authentication-domain security policy

It does not mean:

- `system/iam` user, role, menu, and permission management
- `system/org` organization ownership governance
- `platform` application shell and dashboard aggregation

## 3. Goals

The `system/auth` contract exists to lock down:

1. the boundary between `auth` and `iam`
2. the rule that the auth primary path revolves only around identity verification and session validity
3. the rule that security center, session management, and login logs belong to `auth`
4. the distinction between reserved future security capabilities and real protocol implementation
5. the definition of done and acceptance semantics for the auth domain

## 4. Non-Goals

This contract does not cover:

- user-list CRUD
- role CRUD
- menu and permission-policy CRUD
- department and post governance
- business-domain account models
- real `CAPTCHA / SSO` protocol flows before the identity source is defined

In other words:

- `auth` may reserve capability switches such as `CAPTCHA / SSO`
- but it must not damage the current local username-password primary path in the name of future flexibility

## 5. Boundaries

### 5.1 Covered Surfaces

- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/verify`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
- `GET /api/v1/auth/sessions`
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/sessions/:id`
- `PUT /api/v1/auth/password`
- `GET /api/v1/auth/security`
- `/login`
- `/auth/security`
- `/system/session`
- `/system/login-log`

### 5.2 Excluded Surfaces

- `/system/user`
- `/system/role`
- `/system/menu`
- `/system/permission`
- `/system/dept`
- `/system/post`
- platform-shell navigation and dashboard

## 6. Dependencies

This contract depends on:

- [DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md)
- [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- [BACKEND.md](../designs/BACKEND.md)
- [FRONTEND.md](../designs/FRONTEND.md)
- [AUTH_MODULE_DESIGN.md](../designs/AUTH_MODULE_DESIGN.md)
- [SECURITY_CENTER_DESIGN.md](../designs/SECURITY_CENTER_DESIGN.md)
- [ERROR_CODE_AND_I18N.md](../designs/ERROR_CODE_AND_I18N.md)
- [ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md](../acceptances/ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md)

## 7. Hard Constraints

### 7.1 Domain-Boundary Constraints

- authentication, sessions, tokens, and security policy belong to `system/auth`
- user profiles, role grants, menu management, and permission-point governance belong to `system/iam`
- `auth` must not take over backoffice user-management CRUD

### 7.2 Primary-Path Constraints

- login, refresh, logout, sessions, and password form one authentication primary path
- security policy may only affect the auth primary path and must not leak without boundaries into other system-domain pages
- current-account sessions and administrator-visible login logs should both be understood from auth-domain semantics, not pushed into `iam`
- `/login` may expose language selection, but the runtime priority of that choice is interpreted by the `platform` shell
- `system/auth` must not automatically persist login-page language choice as long-term user preference
- `preferences.language` in `auth/me` or login responses is only the default preference source, not the final interpreter of current-session language

### 7.3 MFA and Reserved-Capability Constraints

- `login.mfa_enabled` now participates in real TOTP second-factor verification; disabling it must not break the original username-password path
- real MFA currently means TOTP verification after local username-password login, not external-identity SSO
- when MFA is enabled for the first time, users without a bound factor must be allowed to bind through QR/manual-secret flow instead of being locked out
- the login page must expose at least two of the following: QR code, manual secret, `otpauth://` URI, with QR preferred and manual secret as fallback
- the backend must never echo the current OTP code itself; it may return only the secret/URI required for a local authenticator app to generate the six-digit code
- `login.captcha_enabled` and `login.sso_enabled` may remain as configuration switches
- until a real protocol exists, fake CAPTCHA or SSO entry points must not be displayed
- until the identity source is defined, real `SSO / OIDC / OAuth2 / WeCom` integration must not be implemented early

### 7.4 Security Constraints

- auth failure throttling, source/IP limits, session idle timeout, and maximum active sessions must be centrally owned by `auth`
- login logs, request identity, and session revocation chains must remain traceable
- auth-domain errors should prefer stable keys rather than natural-language strings

### 7.5 Documentation Constraints

- all `system/auth` design, assessment, remediation, and acceptance docs must link back to this contract
- if an “auth-related” change actually modifies user-management behavior in `iam`, the boundary must be explained first

## 8. Definition of Done

`system/auth` should count as currently complete only when:

### 8.1 Responsibility Completion

- `auth` is modeled independently from `user`
- login, sessions, security center, and login logs have clear ownership

### 8.2 Primary-Path Completion

- login, refresh, logout, session listing, and session revocation are stable
- current-user password update is stable
- login logs and security center are stable

### 8.3 Policy Completion

- minimum password length, password complexity, login-failure lockout, source/IP throttling, idle timeout, and max-session policy have a unified policy entry
- reserved capabilities are explicitly marked as either “reserved only” or “real implementation”

### 8.4 Documentation and Acceptance Completion

- auth-related design, acceptance, and remediation docs all link back to this contract
- acceptance can clearly distinguish between “design reserved” and “real protocol implementation”

## 9. Acceptance Standards

Changes in `system/auth` must at least pass:

### 9.1 Documentation Acceptance

- [ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md](../acceptances/ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md)
- [DOCUMENT_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT.md](../contracts/DOCUMENT_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT.md)
- [DOCUMENT_METADATA_AND_STATUS.md](../contracts/DOCUMENT_METADATA_AND_STATUS.md)

### 9.2 Backend and API Acceptance

- `go test ./backend/modules/auth`
- if tracking chains or middleware are touched, add `go test ./backend/internal/middleware`

### 9.3 Frontend and Build Acceptance

- `cd frontend && npm run build`
- if the auth primary path or security-page primary path changes, add smoke or acceptance evidence

### 9.4 Page and Primary-Path Acceptance

- `/login`
- `/auth/security`
- `/system/session`
- `/system/login-log`

Additional checks:

- when `login.mfa_enabled=false`, username-password login must remain usable
- when `login.mfa_enabled=true` and the user has no bound factor, `/login` must enter the binding flow instead of failing directly
- when the username or password is wrong, the login page must show the translated auth-domain error key, not a vague generic failure
- when second-factor code is wrong, challenge expires, or source/IP is limited, the login page must prioritize translated backend error keys

### 9.5 Reserved-Capability Acceptance

- if docs claim `MFA / CAPTCHA / SSO` are reserved only, they must explicitly say they are not real protocol implementations
- if the implementation becomes real, it must have a dedicated design and acceptance chain instead of reusing the “reserved” framing

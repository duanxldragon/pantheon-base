# GitHub Governance Checklist

Use this checklist when enabling the execution flow described in `docs/designs/WORKFLOW.md` and `docs/acceptances/CODE_REVIEW_STANDARD.md`.

## Repository settings

- Protect `main` and `release/*`
- Require conversation resolution
- Restrict direct pushes to protected branches
- Allow auto-merge
- Keep required approvals at `0` for the current solo-maintainer workflow
- Prefer squash merge
- Automatically delete head branches after merge

## Required checks

- `Quality Gates`
- `Security Gates`
- Keep PR-required checks limited to fast, deterministic merge-gate jobs
- Set branch-protection status checks to non-strict (`strict=false`) so auto-merge does not stall on "must be up to date"
- Keep `Full Smoke Suite` manual, scheduled, or release-precheck only
- Keep Sonar、Codacy 和 OCR out of required checks

## Secrets

- Any repository secrets needed by active security or deployment workflows

## Review evidence

- PR description records ownership layer, boundary, validation, `Quality Gates`, `Security Gates`, and CodeQL status
- PR description records Copilot review status or explicit unavailability
- PR description records auto-merge status
- High-risk PRs record residual risk and rollback notes explicitly
- Closeout records merged PR URL, merge commit, and branch cleanup status
